            <h2>Delivery</h2>
            <p>The first time you register on the website, and if you’re approved, you’ll receive counsel via a phone call from a partner pharmacist to confirm your details and discuss the active ingredients. If you’re not readily available to receive this phone call, delivery times will increase, as only once this phone call has been completed will your order be prepared, dispensed and dispatched by the pharmacist via express post with Australia Post.</p>
            <h3>On-Going Delivery</h3>
            <p>Every delivery other than your first delivery referenced above (deliveries after three months and every three months thereafter) should take between 3 – 5 business days.</p>
            <h3>Tracking</h3>
            <p>With every dispatch, you’ll receive Australia Post tracking information via email.</p>
            <h3>Address Details</h3>
            <p>It’s advisable to provide an address where you’ll be present to receive your order during normal business hours.
      
            Please note, as we’re reliant on third parties such as Australia Post, we take no responsibility for any loss or damage during delivery.

      <p>We’ll provide you with a full refund if you decide not to continue once you speak with the pharmacist (after doctor approval) but before your treatment has been produced and dispatched by the pharmacist. You’ll receive a full refund for the purchase price in Australian Dollars (AUD).</p>
      <p>If your refund is approved, it can take up to 10 business days to be completed.</p>
